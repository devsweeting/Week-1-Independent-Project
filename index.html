            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>Devin was born in the green wonder of the Pacific NW <em>Portland-freakin-Oregon</em>. He was raised in the heart of St. Johns. He grew up thinking he wanted to be Spider-man, but because radioactive power-giving spiders don't exist yet he's settled for a normal existence as a student, a son, a brother, a friend, and a caring cat-daddy.</p>
              <p>He went to Benson Polytechnic HIghschool and studied automechanics and communications. After graduation he pursued higher education at Portland State University</p>

During most of the 18th century, the penny was a small silver coin rarely seen in circulation. </p>
